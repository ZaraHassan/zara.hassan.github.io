I currently serve as a PhD candidate at the ANU-CECC School of Computing, where I am engaged in research under the guidance of two esteemed mentors, Dr. Alex Potanin from CECC-ANU and Dr. Christoph Treude from the University of Melbourne.

My research journey is defined by a profound curiosity and a commitment to addressing critical challenges in the realm of Software Engineering. My primary research interests revolve around Empirical Software Engineering, with a particular focus on Technical Debt. I am intrigued by the intricacies of scientific software and its reproducibility in the context of data science and scientific research. My work aims to enhance the reliability and transparency of these critical software systems, thereby contributing to the advancement of science and technology. 

Before embarking on my PhD journey, I earned my Master's degree in Information Technology (MSIT) from the prestigious National University of Science and Technology (NUST-SEECS). During my master's program, I delved into the domains of Requirements Engineering and Self-Adaptive Systems under the supervision of Dr. Nauman A Qureshi.
My academic and research endeavours reflect my unwavering commitment to innovation and aspiration to make a lasting impact on the world of Scientific Software Engineering.
